# Intelligent To-Do App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Transform complex tasks into achievable actions through AI-powered breakdown, eliminating cognitive overwhelm
- Achieve 40% monthly active user retention by month 6 (vs. 15% industry average)
- Increase user task completion rate to 75% for complex tasks (vs. current 35%)
- Deliver time-to-value within 7 days of onboarding with measurable productivity improvement
- Create "fulfillment over productivity" user experience that reduces task planning time by 40%
- Build user base to 3,000 Daily Active Users (DAU) and 12,000 registered users by month 6, establishing foundation for 10K DAU by month 12

### Background Context

The Intelligent To-Do App addresses a critical gap in task management: the cognitive overwhelm caused by manually breaking down complex tasks. Current solutions force users into "grinding complexity" where 60% of complex tasks are abandoned due to lack of clear starting points. This system leverages AI-powered task breakdown combined with context-aware interfaces to transform user experience from overwhelming task lists into achievable action sequences.

The solution targets three primary personas - overwhelmed professionals, ambitious students, and busy parents - who need intelligent task management that adapts to their specific contexts while maintaining the control and privacy required for both personal and professional use.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The system accepts natural language task input and automatically parses complex tasks into actionable sub-tasks with logical sequencing recommendations

**FR2**: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks and sub-tasks with basic organization capabilities

**FR3**: The system automatically assigns achievability scores to tasks and matches them against user capability patterns to suggest optimal task ordering

**FR4**: Users can separate and switch between work and personal task contexts with basic privacy controls

**FR5**: The system provides visual progress indicators for complex tasks and maintains completion statistics

**FR6**: Users can modify AI-generated task breakdowns and sub-task sequences to match their preferences

**FR7**: The system maintains task history and allows users to restore or reference previous task breakdowns

**FR8**: Users can mark sub-tasks as complete and track overall progress toward parent task completion

**FR9**: The single input field accepts natural language that includes temporal elements (dates, times, deadlines) and automatically extracts and applies relevant metadata tags to tasks (due dates, priority indicators, context clues, etc.)

**FR10**: The system automatically suggests or applies priority levels based on parsed temporal urgency and context clues from natural language input

**FR11**: The system allows users to upload or link documents/files to tasks and provides AI-powered content analysis, summaries, and actionable insights relevant to task completion (e.g., "Review Q4 budget" can upload budget file and receive summary analysis)

**FR12**: Document assistance features integrate with task breakdown, suggesting specific subtasks based on document content analysis (e.g., budget review generates subtasks for specific sections or concern areas)

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: AI task breakdown response times must be under 2 seconds to maintain user engagement and flow

**NFR2**: The system must support offline capability for basic CRUD operations without AI features

**NFR3**: All task data must be encrypted end-to-end with secure API authentication for privacy compliance

**NFR4**: The application must be responsive and functional on modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)

**NFR5**: The system must maintain 99.5% uptime during business hours to support professional users

**NFR6**: AI API costs must be optimized to support freemium model sustainability

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a "fulfillment over productivity" interface that eliminates cognitive overwhelm through intelligent simplicity. The primary interaction should feel like conversing with an intelligent partner rather than managing a complex tool. Single input field dominates the interface, with context-aware adaptations that subtly adjust based on user persona (professional efficiency vs. student engagement vs. parent practicality).

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational Task Entry**: Primary interaction through natural language input field that accepts complex instructions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: AI-generated breakdowns reveal incrementally, avoiding overwhelming information dumps
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Interface subtly shifts visual priority and coaching tone based on detected work/personal context
- **Gentle Guidance**: System provides intelligent suggestions without forcing specific workflows or micromanaging user behavior

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Dashboard**: Dominated by single input field with context toggle (Work/Personal) and recent task overview
- **Task Breakdown View**: Shows AI-generated subtask sequences with progress tracking and modification capabilities
- **Context Management Screen**: Simple work/personal separation with privacy controls
- **Progress & Analytics View**: Visual completion statistics and fulfillment metrics without overwhelming productivity pressure

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensure professional users can rely on the application in corporate environments requiring accessibility compliance.

### Branding
Clean, modern aesthetic that conveys intelligent simplicity rather than productivity pressure. Color psychology should emphasize calm focus (blues/greens) over urgency (reds/oranges). Visual design should feel more like a thoughtful assistant than a demanding taskmaster.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Desktop-first for professional users with mobile-responsive design. Interface must work seamlessly across devices as users switch between work and personal contexts throughout their day.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository with separate packages for frontend, backend, and shared TypeScript types. This supports your bootstrap approach while remaining scalable for future team growth.

### Service Architecture
**Initial**: Monolithic architecture within the monorepo for MVP simplicity and rapid development  
**Future-Ready**: Microservices-ready structure that can be split as complexity and team size grow  
**Critical Decision**: Start simple but architect for eventual service separation, particularly for AI processing components

### Testing Requirements
**MVP Phase**: Unit testing only for core business logic and AI integration points  
**Post-MVP**: Full testing pyramid including integration and end-to-end testing  
**Critical Decision**: Focus testing efforts on AI reliability and task breakdown accuracy rather than comprehensive coverage initially

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Stack**:
- React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- Tailwind CSS for rapid responsive design matching your timeline constraints
- React Query/TanStack Query for efficient API state management
- Vite for fast development builds

**Backend Stack**:
- Node.js with NestJS framework (provides structure for scaling beyond solo development)
- TypeScript throughout for shared types and reduced integration bugs
- PostgreSQL for structured task/user data with relationships
- Redis for session management and AI response caching

**AI Strategy**:
- **MVP Phase**: Rule-based task breakdown system with intelligent pattern matching and template library
- **Pattern Recognition Engine**: Custom parsing for common task types (planning, reviewing, researching, creating, etc.)
- **Template Library**: 20-30 smart task breakdown templates covering 80% of common scenarios
- **AI-Ready Architecture**: Service abstraction layer that can seamlessly integrate GPT-4/3.5 API for complex tasks that exceed rule-based capabilities
- **Hybrid Fallback**: Users can optionally trigger AI breakdown for complex tasks (manual API cost incurred)

**Task Breakdown Service Architecture**:
```
TaskBreakdownService {
  tryRuleBasedBreakdown() → success/failure
  fallbackToAI() → optional API call
  combineResults() → final breakdown
}
```

**Rule-Based Intelligence**:
- Natural language parsing for temporal elements (dates, deadlines, priorities)
- Context detection (work/personal keywords and patterns)
- Task type classification (research, planning, creation, review, communication)
- Template matching with smart variable substitution

**AI Integration Preparation**:
- Standardized breakdown format compatible with both rule-based and AI responses
- Usage tracking and cost monitoring ready for API integration
- A/B testing framework to measure rule-based vs AI effectiveness
- Progressive enhancement: rules handle common cases, AI handles edge cases

**Cost Model**:
- MVP: $0 operational costs for task breakdown
- Post-MVP: Optional AI features as premium capability or pay-per-use
- Revenue-driven: AI costs covered by subscription revenue before full rollout

**Infrastructure & Deployment**:
- Containerized with Docker for consistent deployment environments
- Vercel for frontend hosting (excellent React/Next.js integration)
- Railway or similar for backend hosting (cost-effective for bootstrap budget)
- Automated CI/CD pipeline for reliable deployments

**Security & Privacy**:
- JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- End-to-end encryption for all task data
- GDPR compliance architecture for EU users
- AI API data handling policies that ensure user privacy
