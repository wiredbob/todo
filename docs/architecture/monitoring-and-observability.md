# Monitoring and Observability

## Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics for Web Vitals, user interactions, and performance metrics
- **Backend Monitoring:** Vercel Functions logs and metrics, custom logging for business events
- **Error Tracking:** Sentry for error aggregation and alerting (free tier supports MVP needs)
- **Performance Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics for response times, Supabase dashboard for database performance

## Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
- JavaScript errors and error rates
- API response times from client perspective
- User interactions (task creation, completion rates)
- Task breakdown success rates

**Backend Metrics:**
- API request rate and response times
- Error rate by endpoint
- Task processing time (must be < 2s per PRD)
- Database query performance
- Template matching accuracy
- User conversion rates (registration → first task → task completion)
