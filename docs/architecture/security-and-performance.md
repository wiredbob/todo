# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: Content-Security-Policy with strict-dynamic and nonce-based inline scripts
- XSS Prevention: Input sanitization, output encoding, React's built-in XSS protection
- Secure Storage: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies, sensitive data encrypted

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Zod schema validation on all API endpoints
- Rate Limiting: Vercel's built-in rate limiting (100 requests/minute per IP)
- CORS Policy: Restricted to frontend domain only

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: JWT in secure, httpOnly cookies with SameSite=strict
- Session Management: Supabase Auth with automatic token refresh
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters, complexity requirements via Supabase

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 500KB gzipped main bundle
- Loading Strategy: Code splitting, lazy loading for routes
- Caching Strategy: Browser caching for static assets, SWR for API data

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 2 seconds for task breakdown (PRD requirement)
- Database Optimization: Proper indexing, connection pooling via Supabase
- Caching Strategy: In-memory template caching, Supabase edge caching
