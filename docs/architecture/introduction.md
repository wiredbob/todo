# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the **Intelligent To-Do App**, a revolutionary task management system that transforms complex tasks into achievable actions through AI-powered breakdown. The architecture supports both immediate MVP delivery via rule-based intelligence and future evolution to full AI integration.

This unified approach addresses the core product vision: eliminating "cognitive overwhelm" by converting complex task lists into manageable action sequences. The architecture must support 40% user retention goals while maintaining sub-2-second response times and zero operational AI costs during MVP phase.
