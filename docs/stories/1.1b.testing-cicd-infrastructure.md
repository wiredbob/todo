## Dev Notes

### Testing Strategy
Implements testing pyramid approach:
- **Unit Tests**: Component logic, API function logic, utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints with mock database, component integration
- **Future E2E**: Playwright (handled in later stories)

### Test File Structure
```
apps/web/tests/
├── components/
│   └── HelloWorld.test.tsx        # Sample component test
├── utils/
│   └── testHelpers.ts             # Testing utilities
└── setup.ts                      # Test configuration

apps/api/tests/
├── health.test.ts                 # Sample API test
└── utils/
    └── testHelpers.ts             # API testing utilities
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run type-check

  deploy-preview:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    needs: test
    # Vercel preview deployment

  deploy-production:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: test
    # Vercel production deployment
```

### Health Check Endpoints
- **Frontend**: `/health` - Shows build version, deployment info
- **Backend**: `/api/health` - Shows API status, database connectivity, environment

### Code Quality Configuration
- **ESLint**: TypeScript, React, monorepo-aware rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent formatting across all files
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with shared tsconfig.json
- **Pre-commit**: Lint, format, and type-check before commits

### Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npm run test:web && npm run test:api",
    "test:web": "cd apps/web && vitest run",
    "test:api": "cd apps/api && vitest run",
    "test:watch": "npm run test:web -- --watch",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx",
    "lint:fix": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --fix",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,json,md}\""
  }
}
```

### Dependencies
Requires Story 1.1 (Core Infrastructure Setup) to be completed first.
Runs in parallel with Story 1.1a (Database setup).

### Success Verification
After completion:
1. `npm test` runs all tests and passes
2. `npm run lint` shows no errors
3. GitHub Actions runs on new PR
4. Vercel deployment works automatically
5. Health endpoints return 200 OK with proper JSON

### Debug Log References
- Vitest configured for both frontend (jsdom) and backend (node) environments
- React Testing Library integrated with proper jest-dom setup
- All test infrastructure working with TypeScript support
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline created with automated testing

### Implementation Approach
**Strategy**: Comprehensive testing infrastructure setup with modern tooling
**Testing Framework**: Vitest for both frontend and backend with proper environment separation
**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with parallel testing and deployment pipelines
**Health Monitoring**: Complete health check endpoints for system monitoring

### Completion Notes
1. **Frontend Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + jsdom environment configured
2. **Backend Testing**: Vitest with Node environment for API endpoint testing
