# Story 1.1: Core Infrastructure Setup

## Status
Ready

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a basic monorepo structure with React frontend and Vercel Functions backend,
**so that** I can start developing features with a working development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Monorepo structure created with separate frontend/backend packages and shared types
2. React + TypeScript frontend configured with Tailwind CSS and Vite
3. Basic Vercel Functions backend configured with TypeScript
4. Basic Supabase client connection established
5. `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend successfully
6. Basic "Hello World" screens render and connect to backend

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Initialize monorepo structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create root package.json with npm workspaces
  - [x] Set up packages/shared for TypeScript types
  - [x] Create apps/web for frontend
  - [x] Create apps/api for Vercel Functions
- [x] Configure frontend development environment (AC: 2, 6)
  - [x] Set up React 18 with TypeScript
  - [x] Configure Tailwind CSS and PostCSS
  - [x] Set up Vite build system with proper config
  - [x] Install and configure UI dependencies (Headless UI, React Router)
  - [x] Create basic "Hello World" landing page
- [x] Configure backend development environment (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Set up Vercel Functions structure
  - [x] Configure TypeScript compilation for functions
  - [x] Set up Supabase client and connection utilities
  - [x] Create basic API endpoint (/api/health)
- [x] Verify end-to-end connectivity (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Ensure frontend can call backend API
  - [x] Verify Supabase connection from backend
  - [x] Test local development startup (`npm run dev`)
  - [x] Create basic integration between frontend and API

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Establishes the **serverless-first architecture** foundation:
- **Repository Structure**: Monorepo with npm workspaces
- **Frontend Stack**: React 18+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Backend Stack**: Vercel Functions, TypeScript, Supabase client
- **Development**: Local development with hot reload

### Project Structure
```
simple-todo/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # React frontend
│   └── api/          # Vercel Functions
├── packages/
│   ├── shared/       # Shared TypeScript types
│   ├── ui/           # Shared UI components
│   └── config/       # Shared configuration
```

### Minimal Deliverable
After completion:
- `npm install` and `npm run dev` works
- Frontend shows "Hello World" page at localhost:5173
- Backend responds to /api/health with JSON
- No database functionality yet (handled in Story 1.1a)

### Environment Configuration
Basic environment variables:
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (for client setup)

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- Primary Agent: Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References
- All tasks completed successfully without major blocking issues
- Minor workspace dependency syntax fixed (workspace:* → *)
- Created custom dev server for API to avoid Vercel CLI authentication requirement in local development

### Completion Notes
1. **Monorepo Structure**: Successfully created npm workspace structure with apps/web, apps/api, and packages/shared
2. **Frontend Setup**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Vite configured with proper proxy to backend
3. **Backend Setup**: Vercel Functions structure with TypeScript, custom development server for local testing
4. **Connectivity**: End-to-end verification successful - frontend at :5173 can communicate with backend at :3000
5. **Developer Experience**: `npm run dev` successfully starts both frontend and backend concurrently

### File List
- `/package.json` - Root package.json with npm workspaces configuration
- `/apps/web/` - Complete React frontend application structure
- `/apps/api/` - Vercel Functions backend with health endpoint
- `/packages/shared/` - Shared TypeScript types and utilities
- `/vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration
- `/.env.example` - Environment variables template

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Infrastructure Assessment

**Acceptance Criteria Compliance: ✅ COMPLETE**
- [✅] Monorepo structure with npm workspaces properly configured
- [✅] React 18 + TypeScript frontend with Tailwind CSS and Vite
- [✅] Vercel Functions backend with TypeScript compilation
- [✅] Supabase client connection utilities established
- [✅] Development servers start successfully with `npm run dev`
- [✅] End-to-end connectivity verified (frontend ↔ backend)

**Quality Attributes Analysis:**

**Architecture & Structure (Strong)**
- Proper monorepo organization following project specifications
- Clean separation of concerns (apps/web, apps/api, packages/shared)
- Appropriate technology stack alignment with requirements
- TypeScript configuration properly established across workspaces

**Development Experience (Strong)**
- Streamlined development workflow with concurrent server startup
- Proper proxy configuration for local API communication
- Environment variable templating in place

**Areas for Improvement:**
- No test framework implementation (deferred to future story)
- Basic error handling present but lacks comprehensive error boundaries
- Production deployment considerations documented but not implemented

### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Areas:**
- Core infrastructure foundation is solid
- TypeScript compilation successful across all workspaces
- Development workflow functional and efficient

**Medium Risk Areas:**
- Absence of test coverage creates technical debt
- Limited error handling for production scenarios
- Security considerations need attention for production deployment
