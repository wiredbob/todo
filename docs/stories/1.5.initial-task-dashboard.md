## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story creates the **main dashboard interface** implementing:

- **UI Design Goals**: "Fulfillment over productivity" interface from PRD
- **Primary Interaction**: Single input field dominance with supportive overview
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Key information without overwhelming the user
- **Responsive Design**: Desktop-first with mobile adaptation

### Dashboard Layout Design
Based on PRD UI specifications:
- **Main Dashboard**: Dominated by single input field with context toggle
- **Recent Task Overview**: Below input field, not competing for attention
- **Progress & Analytics View**: Visual completion statistics without productivity pressure
- **Clean Aesthetic**: Modern design conveying intelligent simplicity

### Component Architecture

    └── StatsSkeleton.tsx      # Statistics loading state
```

### Data Requirements and API Integration
- **Task Statistics**: Total, completed, pending, in-progress counts
- **Recent Tasks**: Last 10 created tasks with metadata
- **Context Breakdown**: Work vs personal task distribution
- **Real-time Updates**: Live updates when tasks are created/completed

### State Management
- **Dashboard State**: Global state for dashboard-specific data
- **Task Data**: Reuse from Story 1.4 task management
- **User Context**: Work/personal context state
- **Loading/Error States**: UI state management for all async operations

### Visual Design Implementation
- **Color Scheme**: Blues/greens for calm focus (per PRD)
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy, readable fonts
- **Spacing**: Generous white space for clean feel
- **Icons**: Subtle, supportive icons not overwhelming
- **Animations**: Gentle transitions, no aggressive movement

### Performance Considerations
- **Data Fetching**: Efficient queries for dashboard data
- **Component Loading**: Lazy loading for non-critical components
- **Cache Strategy**: Appropriate caching for statistics data
- **Bundle Size**: Optimize dashboard component size

### Responsive Design Strategy
- **Desktop**: Full dashboard with side-by-side layout
- **Tablet**: Stacked layout maintaining input prominence
- **Mobile**: Single column, input-first design
- **Touch Interactions**: Proper touch targets and gestures

### Integration Points
- **Story 1.3**: TaskInput component integration
- **Story 1.4**: Task data and CRUD operations
- **Story 1.2**: User authentication and context
- **Future Stories**: Context switching, progress tracking

### Testing Standards
- **Component Tests**: Dashboard rendering, responsive behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Data fetching and display
- **Visual Tests**: Responsive design across breakpoints
- **Performance Tests**: Dashboard loading time optimization
- **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader navigation, keyboard interaction

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Network Errors**: Graceful degradation with retry options
- **Data Errors**: Fallback to cached data where appropriate
- **Component Errors**: Error boundaries with recovery options
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens for better perceived performance
