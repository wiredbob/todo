# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Task Management

## Epic Goal

Establish a fully functional task management foundation with user authentication, database operations, and the signature single-input interface that immediately demonstrates intelligent parsing capabilities, providing users with a superior task entry experience from day one.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Greenfield project - no existing functionality
- Technology stack: React 18+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite (frontend), NestJS with Node.js, PostgreSQL, Supabase (backend)
- Integration points: New monorepo structure with Vercel Functions and Supabase integration

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Complete foundational infrastructure including user authentication, basic CRUD operations, and intelligent single-input interface with natural language processing
- How it integrates: Serverless architecture on Vercel platform with Supabase as managed database and auth provider
- Success criteria: Users can register, login, create tasks through natural language input, and experience immediate intelligent parsing with hierarchical task breakdown

## Stories

### Foundation Stories (Can run in parallel after 1.1)
1. **Story 1.1:** Core Infrastructure Setup - Basic monorepo, React frontend, Vercel Functions backend, "Hello World" screens
2. **Story 1.1a:** Development Database & Test Data - Local Supabase, database schema, comprehensive test data fixtures
3. **Story 1.1b:** Testing & CI/CD Infrastructure - Test frameworks, GitHub Actions, deployment pipeline, code quality
4. **Story 1.1c:** Basic UI Boilerplate - Placeholder screens, routing, navigation, responsive design

### Feature Stories (Depend on Foundation Stories)
5. **Story 1.2:** User Authentication System - Secure registration, login, JWT token management, and profile functionality
6. **Story 1.3:** Single-Input Task Creation Interface - Prominent natural language input field with real-time processing feedback
7. **Story 1.4:** Basic Task CRUD Operations - Full task lifecycle management with hierarchical subtask support
8. **Story 1.5:** Initial Task Dashboard - Overview interface with statistics, recent tasks, and quick actions
9. **Story 1.6:** Intelligent Input Processing with Hierarchical Task Support - Natural language parsing service with metadata extraction and task hierarchy management

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Database schema supports hierarchical task relationships with proper foreign keys
- [ ] API endpoints follow consistent REST patterns for future service scaling
- [ ] Authentication system integrates seamlessly with Supabase Auth
- [ ] Frontend components use shared TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- [ ] Service abstraction layer prepares for future AI integration without breaking changes

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Complex monorepo setup and Supabase integration challenges during initial development phase
- **Mitigation:** Start with minimal viable configuration, use Supabase documentation and community examples, implement comprehensive testing from day one
- **Rollback Plan:** Each story is independently deployable; can revert to previous working state through git and Vercel deployment history

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 6 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Users can register, authenticate, and manage tasks through single-input interface
- [ ] Intelligent input processing demonstrates metadata extraction and basic task breakdown
- [ ] Hierarchical task support functional with parent-child relationships
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for authentication, task CRUD, and input processing
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional with automated testing and deployment
- [ ] Production deployment on Vercel with Supabase integration working
