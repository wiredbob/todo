├── pages/
│   ├── LoginPage.tsx          # Basic login form placeholder
│   ├── DashboardPage.tsx      # Simple dashboard placeholder

    └── testHelpers.ts         # Development utilities
```

### Routing Structure
```typescript
// Basic route configuration
const routes = [
  { path: '/', element: <DashboardPage /> },
  { path: '/login', element: <LoginPage /> },
  { path: '/dashboard', element: <DashboardPage /> },
  { path: '*', element: <NotFoundPage /> }
];
```

### Placeholder Content Strategy
- **LoginPage**: Simple form with email/password fields (non-functional)
- **DashboardPage**: Welcome message, navigation menu, health status
- **PlaceholderCard**: Consistent "Feature coming in Story X.X" messaging
- **Navigation**: Home, Login, Dashboard links

### Backend Integration
- Health check endpoint call to verify API connectivity
- Display system status information
- Environment detection (development/production)
- Basic error handling for API failures

### Responsive Design Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 320px - 768px (single column, larger touch targets)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (adapted layout, touch-friendly)
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (full layout, mouse interactions)

### Local Development Verification Checklist
After Story 1.1c completion, developer should verify:
1. ✅ `npm run dev` starts without errors
2. ✅ Frontend loads at http://localhost:5173
3. ✅ Navigation between login/dashboard works
4. ✅ Health check shows green status with API connectivity
5. ✅ Responsive design works on mobile/desktop
6. ✅ All placeholder components render correctly
7. ✅ Browser console shows no JavaScript errors

### Dependencies
- Requires Story 1.1 (Core Infrastructure Setup)
- Requires Story 1.1b (Health check endpoints from CI/CD story)
- Can run in parallel with Story 1.1a (Database setup)

### Integration Points
- **Story 1.2**: Login placeholder will be replaced with real authentication
- **Story 1.3**: Single input field will be added to dashboard
- **Story 1.5**: Dashboard placeholder will become full dashboard

### Success Criteria
The application should feel like a "real app" with:
- Professional-looking placeholder screens
- Smooth navigation between sections
- Clear indication of what's coming next
- No broken links or JavaScript errors
- Good mobile experience
